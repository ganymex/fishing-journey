# My Fishing Journey and Lessons Learned

This page shares my personal journey into fishing, along with the lessons I’ve picked up from online resources and invaluable advice from experienced friends. It covers some general principles for successfully catching fish, as well as my observations and experiences at various lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and shorelines I’ve visited. So far, all the locations are in California.

## General Principles for Fishing

### Saltwater

> If you really want to catch a fish, go on a charter boat.

#### Time and Tide

The most important factors in saltwater fishing are *time* and *tide*. Generally, the best times to fish are around sunrise and sunset, especially during a rising tide. In California summers, sunrise often coincides with a rising tide, making early morning an ideal time to fish. By evening, the tide typically peaks before sunset, making the morning more productive overall.

#### Water Depth and Layers

When fishing from shore, water layering isn't a major concern since the depth is relatively shallow. Fish live where the foods are.

#### Tackle and Equipment

> Fishing piers are great spots, but you'll need to bring a drop net to land larger fish.

Use leaders with a higher or equal pound-test rating compared to your main PE line for improved abrasion resistance. Fluorocarbon is generally preferred due to its toughness.

For leader-to-mainline knots, many people say PR knot is the strongest and smoothest, though I don't have any experience with it. GT knot is bulkier, but ome people say it is better than FG knot for saltwater fishing, probably because with the method for saltwater casting, we put the knot outside the last rod guide so even it's bulky it won't 卡导环.

#### Dangerous Species

Marine fish can be dangerous to human. In the first place, If you're unsure how to safely deal with a catch, it’s best to cut the line and release it. Most hooks will rust out or be expelled by the fish eventually.

Species to be cautious around:

- **Sharp-Finned Fish (e.g., White Sand Bass)**  
  These fish have pointed dorsal fins that can puncture skin. Handle with care or use a fish gripper.

- **Sharks and Barracuda**  
  Both have sharp teeth and can attack human, even on land. Avoid handling them directly. Use long pliers or cut the line when necessary.

- **Stingrays**  
  Their barbs are venomous and capable of causing serious injury. Some anglers remove the barb, but this is unnecessary and harmful (they will temporarily lose the ability to protect themselves from predators). Instead, place the ray flat on the ground and remove the hook from the the head. Grippers are not helpful here.

- **Scorpionfish**  
  Their spines are venomous and extremely painful to touch. Always use a gripper or pliers and keep hands away from the fins.

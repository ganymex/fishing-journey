# Fishing Spots Experience

This page includes my experience of all the fishing lakes, reserviors, rivers, and shores I have been to since I started learning fishing. Now only in California.

## Venice Fishing Pier

Always remember, to fish saltwater, the most important factor is the time and tide. You always want to fish at sunrise/sunset, with rising tides.

# Fishing Experience

This page includes my personal experience of what I've learned for fishing along the way. It includes some general rules to successfully catch a fish, as well as experience of some fishing lakes, reserviors, rivers, and shores I have been to since I started learning fishing. Now only in California.

## General Rules for Fishig

### Saltwater
Always remember, to fish saltwater, the most important factor is the time and tide. You always want to fish at sunrise/sunset, with rising tides. Usually, at least per my own observations during summer in California, the sunrise comes with a rising tide. But in the evening, the tides are usually before sunset. That's why morning is the best time for fishing
